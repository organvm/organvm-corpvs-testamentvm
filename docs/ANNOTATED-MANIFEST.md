## I. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

This directory is a **complete planning, evaluation, and implementation corpus** for an eight-organ creative-institutional system ("ORGAN I–VII + Meta"). It describes the architecture, governance, documentation standards, deployment automation, public narrative strategy, and independent cross-AI validation for coordinating ~44 GitHub repositories (42 unique; 14 local repos pending migration) across 8 GitHub organizations (7 organ orgs + 1 meta-org).

The system is designed to:
1. Protect distinct modes of work (theory, art, commerce, community) from collapsing into each other
2. Present the entire meta-system as a portfolio asset for grant funding, AI hiring, and residencies
3. Launch via a **tiered "Bronze" path** (5 flagships + registry + essay first) rather than all-at-once

**Current state (post-reconciliation):**
- Phase -1 (org architecture + config files): **DONE** — `.config/organvm.env`, `.config/organvm.config.json`, `.config/organvm.env.local` created
- TE conversion: **DONE** — 278 edits across 15 files by 4 parallel AI agents
- Budget reconciliation: **DONE** — all docs agree on ~4.4M TE Phase 1, ~6.5M TE total
- Independent AI cross-validation: **DONE** — 3 models × 2 runs, consensus: Bronze tier, registry hardening, 10% coordination tax
- Org rename/creation on GitHub: **NOT STARTED** — human must rename 3 orgs + create 5 new (4 organs + meta-organvm)
- Phase 0 corpus refinement: **NOT STARTED** — blocked on org rename

**Owner:** @4444j99 / @4444J99
**Launch:** Criteria-driven (per D-08 in `08-canonical-action-plan.md`)
**Total TE budget:** ~6.5M TE across 4 sprints (see TE methodology in CLAUDE.md; see `roadmap-there-and-back-again.md` for canonical timeline)
**Strategic pivot:** "Bronze" tier is the canonical launch path — "5 Perfect Repos > 44 Mediocre Repos" (post-cross-validation consensus)

## II. DOCUMENT-BY-DOCUMENT MANIFEST

### Layer 0: Genesis Documents (Conversational Source Material)

---

#### `00-a-system-genesis-transcript.md`
- **Size:** ~397 KB (largest file in directory)
- **Format:** Multi-turn Q&A transcript (ChatGPT-style export)
- **Role:** FOUNDATIONAL SOURCE — the original conversational genesis of the entire system
- **Content spans 6 Q&A exchanges:**
  1. **Q1:** "Ingest & digest ORGAN_i-vii___sub-ORGANS" — Initial charter analysis
     - Produces a table of all 8 organs + 3 backplanes
     - Identifies 3 pathologies the system prevents (art corrupted by commerce, theory compromised by scale, community colonized by metrics)
     - Flags 3 structural vulnerabilities (orchestration single-point failure, public process permeability, personal maintenance collapse)
     - Proposes 3 actionable decisions and 4 recommended next steps
  2. **Q2:** "Does it work as organizational framework + local workspace + GitHub orgs?" — Multi-level scalability analysis
     - Maps organ framework to local filesystem (`~/workspace/ORGAN_*/`)
     - Maps organ framework to GitHub organizations with permission model
     - Identifies integration tension: organs are governance units, not file containers
     - Recommends hybrid structure: GitHub as source of truth, local as working cache
  3. **Q3:** "Detail the promotion/graduation protocol" — State machine design
     - Defines 5 states: LOCAL → CANDIDATE → PUBLIC_PROCESS → GRADUATED → ARCHIVED
     - Each state has: location, duration, permissions, criteria, operational triggers
     - Includes promotion proposal template format
     - Defines orchestration gate mechanics (decision matrix, artifacts required)
  4. *(Continues with further refinements — file is ~500+ lines of analysis)*

- **Key annotations:**
  - This is the intellectual bedrock. All other documents derive from concepts introduced here.
  - The 8-organ model: I (Theory), II (Art), III (Commerce), IV (Orchestration), V (Public Process), VI (Community), VII (Marketing)
  - 3 backplanes: Admin/Legal/Financial, Archival/Memory/Versioning, Personal Maintenance
  - Contains the original vulnerability analysis not repeated elsewhere
  - The Q&A format means it includes both the analytical output AND the reasoning process

---

#### `00-b-local-remote-structure-transcript.md`
- **Size:** ~151 KB (second largest)
- **Format:** Multi-turn Q&A transcript
- **Role:** OPERATIONAL TRANSLATION — converts the abstract organ model into concrete filesystem/GitHub/CI tooling
- **Content spans 4+ Q&A exchanges:**
  1. **Q1:** Audio-transcribed request for local↔remote mirroring — produces ontology layers (ROOT → REALM → ORG_UNIT → REPO_UNIT → WORKSPACE_UNIT → ARTIFACT_UNIT) with 5 invariants
  2. **Environment variable contract:** `WORLD_ROOT`, `AUDIT_ROOT`, `REALMS`, `VCS_HOST`, `ORG_POLICY`
  3. **AI-handoff prompt pack:** 5-phase prompt chain (PROMPT 0–4) for terminal agents to audit `$HOME`, propose topology, generate migration plan, execute with gating
  4. **Q2:** "Design first for Claude, then Codex, then Gemini, then Copilot" — 4 tool-specific prompt adaptations
     - Claude variant: tight plan/stop/resume cycle, `.md` artifacts
     - Codex variant: two-man rule for destructive ops, task-based phases
     - Gemini variant: extensions-first approach, function declarations
     - Copilot variant: workspace/task framework, inline mode directives

- **Key annotations:**
  - Contains the only cross-tool prompt engineering in the corpus
  - The ontology layers (ROOT/REALM/ORG_UNIT/REPO_UNIT) are the naming standard all other documents reference
  - Introduces the "Russian doll" nesting metaphor that shapes the directory design
  - The directory template (`$WORLD_ROOT/realm/<realm_id>/org/<org_unit_id>/repo/<repo_unit_id>/`) is the canonical path formula
  - Includes the critical insight: "repo-inside-repo is prohibited unless declared submodule"

---

#### `00-c-master-summary.md`
- **Size:** ~16 KB
- **Format:** Structured markdown (standalone document, not Q&A)
- **Role:** EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — the "read this first" document for Phase 1 execution
- **Content:**
  - Strategic context: why Phase 1 (documentation audit) is make-or-break
  - 3 critical decisions with analysis:
    1. Personal account consolidation (Archive vs. Mirror — recommends Archive)
    2. Local repos public/private classification (per-organ visibility matrix)
    3. Empty/skeleton repos (populate 4, archive 4, merge 1 — decision matrix per repo)
  - Phase 1 structure: 6 subtasks across Sprints 1–2, ~4.4M TE total
  - Sprint 1: planning (~1.5M TE) — framework, audit, templates, checklists, risk map, setup
  - Sprint 2: execution (~2.4M TE) — README writing per organ, migration, validation
  - Success metrics: 18 checkboxes across documentation, metadata, decisions, QA
  - Effort allocation table by organ (ORGAN-I: ~850K TE, ORGAN-II: ~1,110K TE, etc.)
  - Portfolio positioning guidance for AI hiring, grants, residencies
  - Timeline: Feb 10–23, 2026
  - Common pitfalls (5) and critical success factors (5)

- **Key annotations:**
  - This is the operational entry point — designed to be read in 30 minutes
  - Contains the only explicit timeline with specific dates (Feb 10–23)
  - The decision matrices here are definitive (not repeated in later docs)
  - "Each README is a mini-portfolio piece, not just documentation" — core philosophy
  - References documents 01–05 as sequential outputs

---

#### `00-d-organ-system-audit.md`
- **Size:** ~22 KB
- **Format:** Structured markdown with tables
- **Role:** CURRENT STATE AUDIT — comprehensive inventory of existing GitHub repos mapped to organs
- **Content (8 parts):**
  1. **Executive summary:** 47 remote repos across 4 orgs + 1 personal account; "idea-rich but architecturally orphaned"
  2. **ORGAN-I audit:** 9 repos in organvm-i-theoria org — healthy but repos read as "finished products" when charter says they should "permit incompleteness"
  3. **ORGAN-II audit:** 8 repos in organvm-ii-poiesis — underdeveloped, most repos are shells, no completed art projects
  4. **ORGAN-III audit:** 12 repos in organvm-iii-ergon — healthy commercial engine, needs contract/governance docs
  5. **ORGAN-IV audit:** 3 repos — "not yet a distinct operational function," scattered across theory repos
  6. **ORGAN-V audit:** 5 repos — thin, `life-my--midst--in` is a catch-all, no structured visibility
  7. **ORGAN-VI audit:** 2 repos — not operational, no community infrastructure
  8. **ORGAN-VII audit:** 2 repos — not operational, no marketing systematization
  - **Part 2:** Organization structure assessment with tree diagrams for all 4 orgs
  - **Part 3:** Local workspace recommendation (`~/Workspace/ORGAN_*/` + `BACKPLANE/`)
  - **Part 4:** GitHub restructuring implementation plan (5 steps across 3 weeks)
  - **Part 5:** Promotion workflow with git commands (LOCAL → CANDIDATE → GRADUATED)
  - **Part 6:** Monthly audit checklist + quarterly system review
  - **Part 7:** Immediate action items (this week, next 2 weeks, by end of March)
  - **Part 8:** Expected outcome (7 guarantees) + 5 refinement questions

- **Key annotations:**
  - Date: 2025-02-02 — predates the v2 documents by ~1 year
  - Contains the most detailed per-repo status tables (repo name, org, visibility, status, type)
  - The naming pattern analysis ("Good" vs "Unclear") is only found here
  - Current org breakdown: 4444JPP (17 repos), organvm-i-theoria (16), organvm-ii-poiesis (13), organvm-iii-ergon (11)
  - The 5 refinement questions at the end were likely answered in subsequent documents

---

#### `preparing-ai-handoff-autonomous-agent-scaffolding.md`
- **Size:** ~5 KB
- **Format:** Structured markdown
- **Role:** PRE-LAUNCH DESIGN — agent scaffolding and handoff protocols drafted before the organ system was deployed
- **Key annotations:**
  - Predates the deployed GitHub Actions workflows in `orchestration-start-here`
  - Captures early thinking about how autonomous agents should receive context and hand off work
  - Ingested from parent directory during corpus consolidation

---

#### `universal-orchestrator-architecture.md`
- **Size:** ~14 KB
- **Format:** Structured markdown
- **Role:** EARLY ARCHITECTURE — universal orchestrator design before the ORGAN-IV specialization
- **Key annotations:**
  - Predates the Governor-vs-Engine split in `organ-iv-taxis-architecture.md`
  - Represents the "monolithic orchestrator" phase before decomposition into dispatch/engine/memory components
  - Ingested from parent directory during corpus consolidation

---

#### `gemini-session-2026-02-15-organ-iv-architecture.md`
- **Size:** ~8 KB
- **Format:** Multi-turn session transcript (Gemini CLI export)
- **Role:** SOURCE MATERIAL — reasoning chain for the ORGAN-IV automation engine architecture
- **Content spans 7 turns:**
  1. **Turn 1:** How to stop Jules task sprawl — transition from reactive tasking to architectural orchestration
  2. **Turn 2:** Building for automation — control plane architecture, cascading via webhooks
  3. **Turn 3:** Where to build it — Governor (`.github`) vs Engine (`orchestration-start-here`) pattern
  4. **Turn 4:** Integration with existing `organvm-iv-taxis/.github` repo
  5. **Turn 5:** Full architecture worksheet — API contracts, schemas, event flows, runbooks
  6. **Turn 6–7:** Transcript export and file location confirmation
- **Key annotations:**
  - This is the conversational genesis of `docs/implementation/organ-iv-taxis-architecture.md`
  - Same class as `00-a` and `00-b`: captures reasoning process, not just conclusions
  - Key design decisions: why Governor vs Engine, why cascading, how the 100-task daily cap informs design
  - The "Token Governor" concept (daily_tasks_used < 100) originates here

---

#### `01-artistic-triforce-creative-ontology.md`
- **Size:** ~20 KB
- **Format:** Structured essay (genesis-layer foundational document)
- **Role:** CREATIVE ONTOLOGY — establishes three fundamental creative polarities that cut across all 8 organs
- **Content (7 sections):**
  1. **Preamble** — The artist at 35 recognizing recurring creative lanes; naming the shape
  2. **The Problem** — Unconscious repetition in prolific artists (King, Allen, Whitman as case studies)
  3. **The Three Polarities** — I. Conscious (present, autobiographical, persona as lens), II. Subconscious (hidden, masked, dreamlike, persona as mask), III. Temporal (past/future, mythology, canon, speculation)
  4. **Orthogonality** — 8×3 matrix showing valid polarity × organ combinations; polarities are creative-intent categories, not organizational categories
  5. **The Creative Process as Product** — Eno (environment-builder), Tarantino/Malick (director vs. selector), Reznor/Prince/Wilson (solo multi-instrumentalist), Whitman (one work, lifetime); commodifying the process itself
  6. **Precedents** — Extended case studies: Eno, Tarantino, Malick, Reznor, Prince, Wilson, Whitman
  7. **Relationship to Existing Infrastructure** — taste.yaml (form vs. content), ABSORB classifier (potential future polarity axis), seed contracts (polarity resonance edges)
- **Key annotations:**
  - Sister document to `essay-2-aesthetic-nervous-system.md`: that essay covers form (aesthetic governance), this covers content (creative intent)
  - Orthogonal to the 8-organ structure — any organ's output can be Conscious, Subconscious, or Temporal
  - Establishes vocabulary for a future polarity axis in the ABSORB classifier (not yet implemented)
  - First genesis document numbered `01-` (post-audit), marking a new layer of foundational theory beyond the original `00-` system transcripts
  - Key philosophical position: the creative process itself, made conscious and systematic, is the primary work of art

### Layer 1: Phase 1 Planning Documents (01–05)

These 5 documents form a sequential planning toolkit. Each is self-contained but references adjacent documents.

---

#### `01-readme-audit-framework.md`
- **Size:** ~6.7 KB
- **Format:** Structured methodology document
- **Role:** SCORING RUBRIC — defines what "comprehensive README" means quantitatively
- **Content (5 parts):**
  1. **Scoring rubric (0–100):** 4 dimensions × 20 points each

     - Accuracy & Currency (0–20): valid links, working code, current docs, last update
     - Portfolio Relevance (0–20): why exists, system connection, value prop, evidence
  2. **Score interpretation:** 90–100 (production-ready) → 0–39 (complete rewrite)
  3. **Organ-specific definitions:** Per-organ README requirements with minimum sections and common gaps
     - ORGAN-I: 3,000+ words, 8 required sections
     - ORGAN-II: 2,500+ words + working demos, 9 sections
     - ORGAN-III: 2,000+ words + metrics, 9 sections
     - ORGAN-IV through VII: governance/publishing/participation/strategy focused
  4. **Template instructions:** 8-step process for using templates
  5. **Quality checklist:** 10 must-have items, 6 common mistakes

- **Key annotations:**
  - The 0–100 scoring rubric is the only quantitative evaluation framework in the corpus

---

#### `02-repo-inventory-audit.md`
- **Size:** ~7.7 KB
- **Format:** Structured tables
- **Role:** FULL INVENTORY — every repo numbered, scored, and actionable
- **Content:**
  - **58 total repos** (44 published + 14 local) organized by organ
  - Per-repo columns: #, name, status (✅/⚠️/❌/🔘), current score (0–100), effort estimate (TE), decision (REWRITE/REVISE/POPULATE/ARCHIVE/MERGE)
  - **ORGAN-I:** 10 repos, ~850K TE total, avg 55–70/100, all need REWRITE or REVISE
  - **ORGAN-II:** 13 repos, ~1,110K TE total, avg 0–65/100, mix of REWRITE/POPULATE/ARCHIVE/MERGE

  - Expected review times per AI-generated draft: ORGAN-I/III (15–20 min), ORGAN-II (20–30 min), others (10–15 min)

- **Key annotations:**
  - Templates are deliberately verbose — "customize, don't skip sections"
  - ORGAN-III is the most commercially detailed (pricing, ToS, SLA sections)
  - ORGAN-II uniquely requires demos/videos/images
  - Templates include `[bracketed instructions]` to be replaced

---

#### `04-per-organ-validation-checklists.md`
- **Size:** ~7.0 KB
- **Format:** Checkbox-based checklists per organ

  - **Peer review process:** 6-step workflow (draft → review → feedback → revise → sign-off → commit)
  - **Red flags list:** 7 items that send README back for revision

- **Key annotations:**
  - ORGAN-II has the most stringent requirements (portfolio infrastructure must be complete)
  - ORGAN-III validation includes "Metrics current (within 30 days)" — a living document requirement
  - The peer review process is designed for solo operation (self-review fallback)

---

#### `05-risk-map-and-sequencing.md`
- **Size:** ~12 KB
- **Format:** Structured risk analysis + daily schedule
- **Role:** RISK MANAGEMENT + EXECUTION CALENDAR — what can go wrong and optimal daily order
- **Content (5 parts):**
  1. **Dependency map:** Foundation layer (Sprint 1 must complete before Sprint 2), within-organ dependencies, critical path
  2. **Risk assessment (7 risks):**
     - R1: Documentation burden overwhelming (60%, 5–10 day slip) — use templates, batch similar repos
     - R2: Code examples don't work (40%) — test everything
     - R3: Dependencies incomplete (low) — audit catches these
     - R4: Strategic decisions delayed (medium) — default to "Archive"
     - R5: Peer review bottleneck (medium) — self-review fallback
     - R6: Empty repo decision changes (low) — stick with decision
     - R7: Sprint 2 schedule slips (medium) — ~95K TE contingency buffer
  3. **Optimal sequencing:** Daily breakdown Mon–Sun with specific repos and TE budgets
  4. **Detailed failure scenarios (5):** Scenario A–E with problem, timeline, action, impact, prevention
  5. **Go/No-Go gates (3):**
     - Friday Feb 14 EOD (Sprint 1 gate)
     - Wednesday Feb 19 (Mid-Sprint 2 check)
     - Sunday Feb 23 EOD (Launch gate)
  - **Contingency timeline:** If slips occur, Phase 2 shifts proportionally

- **Key annotations:**
  - The daily breakdown is the most granular schedule in the corpus (per-day, per-organ, per-TE-budget)
  - Critical path insight: ORGAN-II portfolio infrastructure is the bottleneck
  - ORGAN-I and ORGAN-III can run in parallel (no dependencies between them)
  - ORGAN-IV should be done LAST (incorporates findings from all others)
  - The 3 go/no-go gates are the enforcement mechanism for the "complete before moving forward" philosophy

---

### Layer 2: Execution & Strategy Documents

---

#### `phase-1-execution-index.md`
- **Size:** ~12 KB
- **Format:** Document index with reading guide
- **Role:** NAVIGATION GUIDE — "how to use these 6 documents" meta-document
- **Content:**
  - Per-document summary (00–05): what it is, when to read it, what it contains, reading time, action items
  - **Sprint 1 workflow:** Read 00 → make decisions → read 01–02 → skim 03 → create task list → print 04 → read 05 → check go/no-go
  - **Sprint 2 workflow:** Follow daily plan (Doc 05) → write with templates (Doc 03) → review with checklists (Doc 04)
  - **Cross-reference table:** "If you need X, go to document Y"
  - **Success criteria:** 12 checkboxes for Phase 1 completion
  - **FAQ:** 6 common questions (solo vs team, word count minimums, stuck on README, etc.)
  - **Phase 2 preview:** Micro-Validation per Organ (Sprint 3, ~1.0M TE)
  - **Print recommendations:** 4 documents to print for wall reference

- **Key annotations:**
  - Total reading time for all planning documents: ~3 hours
  - Total preparation TE (Sprint 1): ~1.5M TE
  - Total execution TE (Sprint 2): ~2.4M TE (AI generation + human review + validation)
  - This document exists because the corpus is large enough to need a guide to the guide
  - "If any criterion incomplete: Phase 1 extends until complete. Don't move to Phase 2 with partial documentation."

---

#### `parallel-launch-strategy.md`
- **Size:** ~15 KB
- **Format:** Strategic overview + research-backed positioning
- **Role:** STRATEGIC RATIONALE — why parallel launch, and how to position the meta-system for external audiences
- **Content:**
  - **Why parallel:** Sequential launch delays full system visibility by 4+ weeks; parallel makes complete system visible day 1
  - **2026 landscape research:** Meta-system documentation valued by AI labs, grants, residencies
  - **Practitioner precedents:** Julian Oliver, Nicky Case, Hundred Rabbits (updated per `08-canonical-action-plan.md` §7)
  - **3 application strategies:**
    1. AI Systems Engineering (Anthropic, OpenAI, Runway) — lead with registry.json + orchestration
    2. Grant Funding (Knight, Mellon, NEA) — lead with ORGAN-V essays + organizational capacity (NSF CA deprioritized per `08` §6)
    3. Residencies (Eyebeam, Somerset House, Processing) — lead with all 8 organs as unified ecosystem
  - **3-phase implementation summary:** Phase 1 (~4.4M TE docs) → Phase 2 (~1.0M TE validation) → Phase 3 (~1.1M TE integration) = ~6.5M TE total across 4 sprints
  - **Meta-system as portfolio:** Detailed framing for hiring managers, grant reviewers, residency evaluators
  - **Timeline:** 4-week overview (Feb 10 → Mar 3 → ongoing)
  - **5 critical success factors:** documentation-first, phase isolation, all-or-nothing launch, ORGAN-V as narrative, visible decisions

- **Key annotations:**
  - This is the most externally-oriented document — written as if presenting the strategy to a stakeholder
  - The practitioner references (Oliver, Case, Hundred Rabbits — updated per `08` §7) provide art-world legitimacy at current portfolio scale
  - Contains specific application language for each target type (cover letter text, interview talking points)
  - The canonical effort estimate is ~6.5M TE across 4 sprints (see `roadmap-there-and-back-again.md`)
  - "All 8 organs must launch simultaneously, not piecemeal" — the core strategic constraint

---

### Layer 3: v2 Implementation Documents (Current Active Versions)

#### `orchestration-system-v2.md`
- **Size:** ~17 KB
- **Format:** Governance design document
- **Role:** GOVERNANCE SPECIFICATION — how ORGAN-IV coordinates all 8 organs in parallel
- **Content:**
  - **Parallel vs. sequential comparison:** Why simultaneous launch
  - **Architecture diagram:** All 8 organs + connection model (ASCII tree)
  - **5 governance rules:**
    1. Simultaneous operational status (all or nothing)
    2. Documentation-first validation (4-step: README → micro → cross-organ → meta-docs)
    3. Registry as single source of truth (authoritative for all state)
    4. Meta-system documentation as portfolio asset (not overhead)
    5. Parallel organ dependencies (unidirectional flow: I→II→III, documented by V, amplified by VII)
  - **Promotion criteria (post-launch):** Theory→Art, Art→Commerce, All→Public Process, Public→Marketing — with example walkthrough
  - **Orchestration rules:** ORGAN-IV visibility, ORGAN-V explains ORGAN-IV, health checks across all organs

  - **Verification section:** Phase -1 completion checklist (partially complete), launch day verification (9 criteria), critical files table

- **Key annotations:**
  - This is the definitive "what happens when" document — all other plans defer to it
  - Introduces the env-var architecture design (`.config/organvm.env` → `.config/organvm.env.local` → `.config/organvm.config.json`)
  - Contains the consolidation strategy decision: rename 3 existing orgs + create 4 new (not consolidate to personal)

  - 7 suffix variables with Greek ontological names and etymological comments
  - 7 derived org name variables (`ORGAN_I_ORG` through `ORGAN_VII_ORG`)
  - `PERSONAL_ACCOUNT` variable for orphan classification
  - All variables use `${VAR:-default}` pattern for override flexibility

- **Key annotations:**
  - Created during Phase -1 (2026-02-09)
  - "The template is the product. Your instance is one configuration."
  - The suffix scheme: `i-theoria`, `ii-poiesis`, `iii-ergon`, `iv-taxis`, `v-logos`, `vi-koinonia`, `vii-kerygma`
  - Committed to repo (not gitignored) — it IS the shareable template

---

#### `.config/organvm.config.json`
- **Size:** ~1.5 KB
- **Format:** JSON configuration file
- **Role:** MACHINE-READABLE ORG MAP — consumed by registry, workflows, and scripts
- **Content:**
  - `organ_prefix` field (uses `${ORGAN_PREFIX}` template variable)
  - `orgs` object mapping `ORGAN-I` through `ORGAN-VII` to: suffix, env_var name, domain label, Greek etymology

  - Comment block showing the 7 resolved org names

- **Key annotations:**
  - Created during Phase -1 (2026-02-09)
  - **Gitignored** — this file contains instance-specific values, not committed
  - The distinction between `organvm` (template/framework name) and `organvm` (user's org prefix) is intentional
  - Resolves to: `organvm-i-theoria`, `organvm-ii-poiesis`, `organvm-iii-ergon`, `organvm-iv-taxis`, `organvm-v-logos`, `organvm-vi-koinonia`, `organvm-vii-kerygma`

---

#### `scripts/generate-github-configs.py`
- **Size:** ~7 KB
- **Format:** Python 3 script
- **Role:** TEMPLATE GENERATOR — reads `organvm.config.json` + `organvm.env.local` and produces per-org YAML configs and profile READMEs

---

### Layer 4: Evaluation & Cross-Validation

---

#### `06-evaluation-to-growth-analysis.md`
- **Size:** ~37 KB
- **Format:** Structured evaluation with coded findings (C1-C7, R1-R6, B1-B7, S1-S4, E1-E7)
- **Role:** INDEPENDENT EVALUATION — comprehensive critique, reinforcement, and growth analysis of the entire corpus
- **Content (4 phases):**
  1. **Post-Conversion Status Summary:** Scorecard of TE conversion (278 edits, 15 files), org architecture, budget reconciliation
  2. **Phase 1 — Evaluation:**
     - 7 Critiques: C1 (Phantom 16 repos), C2 (TE budget variance), C3 (timeline impossibility), C4 (hidden dependencies), C5 (portfolio paradox), C6 (governance without software), C7 (systematic ~13% optimism)
     - 6 Reinforcements: R1 (org architecture sound), R2 (documentation-first wise), R3 (TE model grounded), R4 (registry-as-truth elegant), R5 (tiered launch pragmatic), R6 (AI-conductor proof — the conversion itself)
     - 7 Blind Spots: B1 (human review bottleneck), B2 (code quality assumption), B3 (no rollback plan), B4 (community chicken-and-egg), B5 (marketing without audience), B6 (archive debt), B7 (coordination overhead ~5-10%)
     - 4 Shatter Points: S1 (if READMEs take 2x), S2 (if code doesn't work), S3 (if GitHub Actions fail across 7 orgs), S4 (if no one reads ORGAN-V)
  3. **Phase 2 — Growth:** 7 Execution recommendations (E1-E7)
  4. **Post-reconciliation additions:** C7, R6, B7, E7 discovered during the TE conversion process

- **Key annotations:**
  - Post-TE-conversion revision (2026-02-09) — includes findings discovered during the reconciliation itself
  - The coded finding system (C/R/B/S/E + number) is referenced throughout subsequent documents
  - C1 (Phantom 16 repos) and C7 (systematic 13% optimism) are the most impactful findings
  - R6 (AI-conductor proof) is strategically significant — the TE conversion is itself evidence the model works
  - This document is the input that drives `07-cross-ai-logic-check-prompts.md`

---

#### `07-cross-ai-logic-check-prompts.md`
- **Size:** ~22 KB
- **Format:** Three structured prompts with document attachment lists
- **Role:** VALIDATION FRAMEWORK — the exact prompts used to cross-validate the corpus via Codex, Gemini, and Copilot
- **Content:**
  - **Post-reconciliation note:** Reflects reconciled state (all TE budgets reference `02` sums)
  - **Prompt 1 (Codex — Technical Feasibility):** 6 attached documents, focuses on registry schema, GitHub Actions viability, env-var architecture
  - **Prompt 2 (Gemini — Strategic Reasoning):** 6 attached documents, focuses on portfolio positioning, grant strategy, Bronze/Silver/Gold approach
  - **Prompt 3 (Copilot — Execution Feasibility):** 6 attached documents, focuses on flagship selection, writing effort estimation, cross-references, templates
  - Each prompt includes: ordered document list, context summary, completed-so-far status, evaluation findings to validate, structured output format (AGREE/DISAGREE/ADD)

- **Key annotations:**
  - The three prompts partition the evaluation space: technical (machine correctness), strategic (positioning), execution (throughput)
  - Each prompt attaches a different subset of the corpus (~6 docs each, with `06` common to all three)
  - The AGREE/DISAGREE/ADD output format enables structured cross-comparison
  - These prompts were executed twice: Run A/B (gemini-cli + github-copilot-cli, identical) and Run C (codex-cli, different responses)
  - **Superseded by:** `08-canonical-action-plan.md` (for action items and D-register resolutions)

---

#### `07-cross-ai-logic-check-results.md`
- **Size:** ~4.7 KB
- **Format:** Executive synthesis with tables
- **Role:** EXECUTIVE VERDICT — the synthesized findings from all three AI validations
- **Content:**
  - **Executive Summary:** Architecture sound; sequential execution plan and binary launch gate unanimously rejected
  - **Verdict:** "The Eight-Organ model is sound. The All-at-Once execution is not."
  - **4 Consensus Findings:** Registry schema blocking, binary launch is critical risk, coordination overhead real (~10%), org architecture solid
  - **3 Key Disagreements + Resolutions:** Launch order (hybrid: fix registry → ORGAN-V → flagships), registry source (manual Phase 1, automate Phase 3), portfolio asset (lead with narrative, prove with code, sustain with automation)
  - **Detailed Findings per model:** Codex (pass/fail/critical add), Gemini (pass/fail/critical pivot), Copilot (pass/fail/critical fix)
  - **Action Plan ("The Bronze Sprint"):** Phase 0 (fix registry, prune, secrets), Phase 1 (essay 1 + 5 flagship READMEs), Phase 2 (deploy validate-dependencies)
  - **Revised Metrics:** ~1.5M TE Bronze + 10% overhead, 2 sprints

- **Key annotations:**
  - "5 Perfect Repos > 44 Mediocre Repos" — the Bronze philosophy
  - Supersedes previous risk assessments in `05` and `06`
  - The 5 flagship repos identified: orchestration-start-here (IV), public-process (V), auto-revision-epistemic-engine (I), core-engine (II), classroom-rpg-aetheria (III)
  - Critical strategic pivot: "Don't just document the system; document the process of building the system"
  - **Superseded by:** `08-canonical-action-plan.md` (the Bronze Sprint action plan is replaced; flagship selection is now exploration-first)

---

#### `08-canonical-action-plan.md`
- **Size:** ~24 KB
- **Format:** Structured decision document with resolved registers, consensus findings, and execution plan
- **Role:** CANONICAL ACTION PLAN — resolves all contradictions from the cross-validation cycle into the executable Bronze Sprint plan
- **Content (9 sections):**
  1. **Resolved Decisions (D-01 through D-08):** Each D-register states the contradiction, resolution, and reasoning with source citations
     - D-01: Budget correction → scenario banding (not single numbers or notes)
     - D-02: Flagship selection → deferred to exploration (not pre-selected from registry)
     - D-03: Bronze TE baseline → band 1.1M–1.6M TE
     - D-04: Narrative lead → meta-system first (AI-conductor methodology)
     - D-05: Sequencing → iterative (registry, essay, and READMEs in parallel)
     - D-06: Framework productization → yes, Phase 2
     - D-07: Tiered classification → criteria defined, assignments deferred to exploration
     - D-08: Timeline → success criteria, not sprint count
  2. **Stable Consensus (8 items):** Registry broken, Bronze is MVL, coordination overhead, TE realistic, process essay priority, human review constraint, two-pass cross-references, tiered templates
  3. **Bronze Sprint Definition:** Scope, TE budget band, success criteria (7 checkboxes)
  4. **Tiered Repo Classification:** Framework only (Flagship/Standard/Stub/Archive criteria), assignments deferred
  5. **Sequencing:** Iterative execution pattern, writing order respecting dependency flow (I→II/III→IV/V)
  6. **What NOT to Do:** 8 rejected items with sources
  7. **Unique Insights Worth Preserving:** Per-model insights from Codex, Gemini, Copilot, and cross-run comparison
  8. **Supersedes:** Table of which documents this plan updates or replaces
  9. **Provenance:** Run metadata, decision authority, synthesis agent

- **Key annotations:**
  - This is the CANONICAL document for Bronze Sprint execution — all D-registers resolved by human decision
  - Replaces `07-cross-ai-logic-check-results.md` action plan and partial aspects of `05` and `implementation-package-v2.md`
  - Key departures from cross-validation recommendations: exploration-first (not pre-selected flagships), iterative sequencing (not infrastructure-first), criteria-driven timeline (not fixed sprints), meta-system narrative lead (not production-first)
  - Source intelligence: 3 AI models × 2 runs = 6,004+ lines of validation analysis synthesized
  - The document itself is evidence of the AI-conductor model: multiple AI systems generate analysis, a coordinating AI synthesizes, and the human decides

## V. NOTABLE PATTERNS & OBSERVATIONS

1. **Versioning discipline:** Clear v1→v2 transition with archive/ preservation; v2 = parallel launch model
2. **Redundancy by design:** Key decisions repeated across 3–4 documents for different reading contexts (executive summary, operational plan, governance spec, registry)
3. **No source code:** This is entirely planning/governance documentation — the actual repos live elsewhere
4. **Portfolio-first philosophy:** Every document frames documentation as an external-facing portfolio asset, not internal overhead
5. **AI-conductor model:** Designed for human direction with AI-parallel execution streams; human reviews AI-generated output
6. **Date context:** Documents reference Feb 2026 launch; the audit (00-d) is dated Feb 2025 — suggesting ~1 year of iterative planning
7. **Scope ambition:** 44 registered repos (42 unique), 8 orgs (8 organs + meta), 14 local migrations, 5 GitHub Actions workflows, 5 flagship essays, newsletter, RSS, POSSE distribution — within ~6.5M TE across 4 sprints
8. **The meta-system IS the work:** The documents consistently argue that orchestration/governance documentation is itself the primary artistic and professional output
9. **Cross-AI validation as methodology:** The corpus includes a complete cross-validation cycle (3 AI models × 2 runs) with provenance tracking, SHA256 integrity hashes, and non-determinism analysis — itself a portfolio piece
10. **Multi-agent layering:** Each AI agent type has its own context doc (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`) — the corpus is designed to be worked on by multiple AI systems simultaneously
11. **Env-var-first architecture:** The org naming system (`.config/organvm.env` → `.config/organvm.env.local` → `.config/organvm.config.json`) makes the entire eight-organ framework forkable — "the template is the product, your instance is one configuration"

## VII. KEY INVARIANTS (Cross-Document)

These rules appear in multiple documents and are never contradicted:

1. **Registry is single source of truth** — all state lives in `repo-registry.json`
2. **No back-edges in dependency graph** — ORGAN-III cannot depend on ORGAN-II; flow is I→II→III only
3. **Repo-inside-repo is prohibited** unless declared as a git submodule
4. **All 8 organs represented at launch** — each organ has at least one flagship repo
5. **Documentation precedes deployment** — no Phase 2 until Phase 1 is complete
6. **Every README is a portfolio piece** — not just internal documentation
7. **Promotion is a state machine** — LOCAL → CANDIDATE → PUBLIC_PROCESS → GRADUATED → ARCHIVED

### Post-Cross-Validation Additions (consensus from 3 AI models × 2 runs)

8. **Bronze tier is the canonical launch path** — 5 flagship repos + registry + essay first, not all 44 at once. "5 Perfect Repos > 44 Mediocre Repos." The all-at-once binary launch gate was unanimously rejected by all 3 AI validators.
9. **Coordination overhead (~10%) must be budgeted** — managing parallel AI streams requires explicit budget allocation (finding B7, validated by all 3 models)
10. **Registry schema must be hardened before execution** — current `repo-registry.json` is missing `dependencies[]`, `promotion_status`, `tier`, and `last_validated` fields required by GitHub Actions workflows
11. **AI validation is non-deterministic for strategy** — same prompts run ~5.5 hours apart produced different strategic recommendations while core technical findings remained stable (documented in `validation-runs/github-copilot-cli/THREE_CLI_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md`)

*Invariants 1–6 are formalized as Articles I–VI in `memory/constitution.md`. Invariants 8–11 are formalized as Amendments A–D. The constitution also defines 4 quality gates (Registry, Portfolio, Dependency, Completeness) enforced by the SDD methodology in `11-specification-driven-development.md`.*
