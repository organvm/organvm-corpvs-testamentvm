# ADR-001: Initial Architecture and Technology Choices

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-02-11

## Context

`organvm-corpvs-testamentvm` is a Python-based project within ORGAN-VIII (Meta) of the organvm eight-organ creative-institutional system. The project needed a technology foundation that balances rapid prototyping with long-term maintainability, aligning with the organ system's emphasis on portfolio-quality engineering.

## Decision

We chose Python as the primary implementation language, leveraging its ecosystem for scientific computing, data processing, and AI/ML integration. The project follows the organvm repository standards (documented in `docs/standards/10-repository-standards.md` of the planning corpus) and integrates with the cross-organ dependency graph maintained in `repo-registry.json`.

Key architectural choices:
- **Language**: Python — selected for ecosystem fit and team expertise
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with graceful degradation (tests, linting, type checking)
- **Documentation**: Portfolio-quality README (4,500+ words) targeting grant reviewers and hiring managers
- **Governance**: Follows ORGAN-IV orchestration rules; no back-edges in dependency graph

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistent with organvm system-wide conventions
- CI pipeline catches regressions early with continue-on-error for non-critical checks
- Documentation-first approach ensures discoverability and portfolio value

### Negative

- Python ecosystem fragmentation (pip vs poetry vs conda) requires flexible dependency detection in CI
- Portfolio-quality documentation requires ongoing maintenance as the project evolves
