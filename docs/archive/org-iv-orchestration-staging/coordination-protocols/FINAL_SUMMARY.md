- [ ] Set status: "Reviewing AI work Dec 11"
- [ ] Don't check outputs until Dec 11

## PHASE B: VALIDATION GATE (Dec 11 Morning)

### Pre-Review Checklist
- [ ] Directory: `~/Desktop/omni-dromenon-machina/` exists
- [ ] Read: `PUSH_ACTION_CARD.txt` (quick reference)
- [ ] Coffee ☕

### Check Task A1 (Consensus Algorithm - Jules)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/omni-dromenon-machina/core-engine

# 1. Does file exist?
[ -f src/consensus/weighted-consensus.ts ] && echo "✅ File exists" || echo "❌ File missing"

# 2. Do tests exist?
[ -f tests/consensus.test.ts ] && echo "✅ Tests exist" || echo "❌ Tests missing"

# 3. Does it compile?
npm install && npm run build
# Expected: No TypeScript errors

# 4. Do tests pass?
npm test
# Expected: All tests pass, coverage report shows ~100%

# 5. Performance acceptable?
npm run benchmark
# Expected: P95 latency <1ms for 1000 votes
```

**Decision:**
- ✅ **PASS:** All checks pass → Approve
- ❌ **FAIL:** Checks fail → Reject, provide feedback

### Check Task A2 (Grant Narrative - Gemini)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/omni-dromenon-machina

# 1. Does file exist?
[ -f GRANT_MATERIALS/ars-electronica-narrative-DRAFT.md ] && echo "✅ File exists" || echo "❌ File missing"

# 2. Word count correct?
wc -w GRANT_MATERIALS/ars-electronica-narrative-DRAFT.md
# Expected: ~1200 words (1150-1250 acceptable)

# 3. Content quality
# Read through: Is it compelling? Academic? Specific metrics cited?
cat GRANT_MATERIALS/ars-electronica-narrative-DRAFT.md
```

**Decision:**
- ✅ **PASS:** ~1200w, compelling, submission-ready → Approve
- ❌ **FAIL:** Wrong length, unclear, generic → Reject, provide feedback

### Check Task A3 (CI/CD Workflows - Copilot)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/omni-dromenon-machina

# 1. Do all 3 workflows exist?
[ -f .github/workflows/test.yml ] && echo "✅ test.yml" || echo "❌ test.yml missing"
[ -f .github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml ] && echo "✅ deploy-docs.yml" || echo "❌ deploy-docs.yml missing"
[ -f .github/workflows/release.yml ] && echo "✅ release.yml" || echo "❌ release.yml missing"

# 2. Are they valid YAML?
for f in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
  if yamllint "$f" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "✅ $f is valid YAML"
  else
    echo "❌ $f has YAML errors"
  fi
done

# 3. Do they have correct triggers?
grep "on:" .github/workflows/test.yml
# Expected: on push/PR
grep "on:" .github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml
# Expected: on push to main when docs/ changes
grep "on:" .github/workflows/release.yml
# Expected: on tags matching v*
```

**Decision:**
- ✅ **PASS:** All 3 exist, valid YAML, correct triggers → Approve
- ❌ **FAIL:** Missing files, YAML errors, wrong triggers → Reject

---

## OVERALL DECISION (After all 3 checks)

### All 3 Pass ✅
```bash
echo "✅ ALL PHASE A TASKS COMPLETE AND APPROVED"
echo ""
echo "Next steps:"
echo "1. Commit all Phase A outputs to git"
echo "2. Push to GitHub: ~/Desktop/omni-dromenon-machina/PUSH_ALL_REPOS.sh"
echo "3. Brief Phase B AI services for demo/video work"
echo "4. Execute Phase C (Dec 13-27)"
```

### One or more fail ❌
```bash
echo "⚠️  PHASE A INCOMPLETE"
echo ""
echo "Action:"
echo "1. Review failures (which task(s) failed?)"
echo "2. Provide specific feedback to AI service"
echo "3. Schedule 24-hour rework"
echo "4. Re-validate Dec 12 or later"
```

## PUSH TO GITHUB (If Phase A Approved)

```bash
# When you're ready to push all repos to GitHub:
~/Desktop/omni-dromenon-machina/PUSH_ALL_REPOS.sh

# Follow on-screen prompts
# Expected: All 12 repos pushed to https://github.com/orgs/omni-dromenon-machina/

# Verify:
gh repo list omni-dromenon-machina --limit 20
# Expected: 12 repos listed
